## ðŸ§  Risk Classification Logic

Each coin is evaluated and labeled based on its recent price volatility:

| Risk Level        | Conditions |
|------------------|------------|
| **Stable**        | 24h change < Â±1% and 7d change < Â±2% |
| **Moderate**      | 24h change < Â±5% and 7d change < Â±8% |
| **High Risk**     | Anything exceeding the above thresholds |

Visual badges and border colors indicate risk at a glance.
